# Private health insurance 

- Actuarially fair premium: Premium based on an individual’s risk of illness

`$$Premium = p \times A$$`

where p is the expected probability of a claim, and A is the amount of the claim in event of an accident.

&lt;br /&gt;

&gt; This activity gives you an opportunity to revise your understanding of how insurance works. Suppose you are part of a community with an annual risk of 1 in 100 of needing hospital treatment and the average cost per case is £1500 plus £5 for administration.

&lt;br /&gt;

- What is your annual actuarially fair premium?

&lt;br /&gt;

- What conditions need to be met for insurance to be offered at this premium?

# Main concerns in private health insurance

  - Moral hazard 
  
    - Cost-sharing 
    
    - Medial savings accounts (MSAs)
  
    - Diagnostic-related groups (DRGs)
  
  - However, 
  
    - Affect the poor 
    
    - does not address supplier induced demand 
    
    - Use services not covered by the DRG system
  
---
# Medical savings accounts in Sigapore

.pull-left[

- MSAs are individual savings accounts that are restricted to spending on health or medical care. 

- They have generally been introduced for one of three reasons: 

  - (1) to encourage savings for the expected high costs of medical care in the future; 
  
  - (2) to enlist health care consumers in controlling costs; and/or 
  
  - (3) to mobilize additional funds for health systems.

# Regulation of private insurance market

- Regulation premium 

- Benefit packages 

- Profits of insurance company 

---
# Managed care 

.pull-left[

- Health maintenance organizations (HMO) 

  - A fixed, periodic per-capita payment (or premium)
  
  - Do not cover services outside the network
  
  - Different models 
  
    - Staff model 
    
    - Group model 
    
    - Network model 
    
    - Independent practice model
    
]

.pull-right[

- Preferred provider organizations (PPO)

  - More generous compared to HMO, but with a higher premium
  
  - Generally cover the services outside the preferred network, but with a higher cost

]

&lt;center&gt;

# Adverse selection is inevitable

### Government intervention 

- prohibit experience rating

  - Experience rating: Insurance premium is based on individual's risk of illness
  
  - Community rating: Insurance premium based on pooled risk of a defined group of people

- extend social insurance

- provide tax funded services for the elderly and the poor

- regulate premiums, profits, or benefit packages or implement tax relief

---

# Socail insurance vs. Private insurance 

- Social insurance is compulsory. Everyone in the eligible group must enroll and pay the specified premium. 


- Social insurance premiums and benefits are described in social compacts (laws) established through legislation.

- It is operated by public agency

# Social insurance vs. tax-based system 

- Not a right of all citizens

- Benefits usually related to the contribution

- Benefits not welfare from the government. 

- Premiums earmarked for social insurance programs and separate from general taxes

- Contribution rates and benefits cannot be arbitrarily changed

---
# Type of Social insurance programs

- Single managing model 

  - Directed and managed by a single national agency

  - Benefits and contribution rates are standardized and risk is usually pooled nationally

  - E.g., Medicare programs in US and NHI in Taiwan

- Bismarckian model: 

  - Multiple insurers (both for-profit and non-profit) 

  - Different premiums and benefits

  - Used in Europe, Latin America, Japan and Korea
---
# SHI vs tax in financing 

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;img src="libs/pic/F11.3.png" width="80%"&gt;

---
# Revenue collection (Arguments)

- Advocate

  - SHI supplemented tax revenues to finance enough healthcare

  - More stable than general tax finance

- Dissent

  - The premium would be very high if using SHI revenue to cover the whole population

  - SHI may displace resources collected from tax revenue for health 

- Problems

  - Dislinkage of contribution with entitlement

  - Contribution evasion

  - SHI contribution is regressive
  
---

# Pooling and risk protection

- Partial population

  - The population size between formal and informal sectors

- Heterogeneous coverage

  - The coverage varied in formal sectors among countries

  - The coverage varied in informal sectors

- Single v.s. multiple risk pools

---
# Health care purchasing and provision 

- The empirical evidence on the merits of purchaser–provider split is thin

- While it is true that many SHI systems are public contract models, and many tax-financed systems are public-integrated systems, the correspondence is by no means one-to-one

# Bending the Cost Growth Curve and Expanding Coverage: Lessons from Germany’s All-Payer System

---
# Proposition 

&gt; None of these countries uses a government-run, Medicare-like health insurance plan. They all rely on **purely private, nonprofit or for-profit insurers** that are goaded by tight regulation to work toward socially desired ends. And they do so at average per-capita health-care costs far below those of the United States

&lt;br&gt; 

&gt; price-discriminatory system be replaced over time by an all-payer system as a means to better control costs and ensure equitable payment

---
# All payer system 

.pull-left[

- All insurers in a state would pay all providers in a state the same price for a given health service

- Uniform fees under the all-payer system are negotiated on a regional basis
]

.pull-right[

### Advantages 

- reduce the administrative cost 

- Contain overall cost growth 

- Social economic status is not the determinant of the price and the value of health care

# Key features of German's systems

1. Solidarity as Explicitly Stated Distributive Social Ethic for German Health Care

2. Self-Governance and the Role of Government

3. Self-Governance and the Role of Government

  1. Financing for the German SHI system is through payroll-based premiums.
  
  2. Collected premiums go into a central risk pool
  
  3. Distribution is based on morbidity-based risk-adjusted capitation basis
---
# Mandate, Coverage, Choice, and Benefits

  - Mandate: Health insurance is mandatory in Germany, and coverage is guaranteed
  
  - SHI covers 87% of Germany’s population of 82.7 million; private
health insurance (PHI) covers 11% or 8.8 million people; and government
insurance schemes, for example, for military, police, and refugees,
cover 2% of the population.

  - Germans can freely choose to join any of the 109 competing nonprofit
SHI sickness funds. Germans can also freely choose doctors and hospitals (when referred to inpatient care). There is no gatekeeping system

  - Comprehensive benefit coverage

# Delivery System, Utilization, and Outcomes

# Lesson learn from German for the United States

- First, Germany’s all-payer system
demonstrates that making explicit the distributive social ethic of a
health care system ismost helpful

- Second, the principle of self-governance and limited role of government
in Germany’s SHI system should appeal to Americans, given the
intrinsic distrust by many of their governmen

- A third lesson is the importance of three coexisting conditions that
are necessary for achieving universal health coverage (UHC).


- Fourth, in addition to the ability to control costs through various
schemes in its all-payer system, there is no price discrimination and no
surprise medical bills, and administrative costs are far lower than in the
United States.

- Finally, Germany’s reference pricing system for pharmaceuticals is
clearly a useful model for the United States
